/*
You always tip 15% of the bill amount. 

To make the calculation easier, you decide to write a program that will do that for you.

Task: Take the bill amount as input and output the corresponding tip amount, which should be 15% of the amount.

To calculate 15% of a number, multiply it by 15, then divide by 100.
